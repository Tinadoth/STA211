.Give an example of a nominal scale measurement of some attribute that you might want
to study in your research area of interest.
Explain why it is nominal.


2. Give an example of an ordinal scale measurement of some attribute that you might want   
to study in your research area of interest.
Explain why it is ordinal.


3. Why are data transformations sometimes used?
If the test being used requires normally distributed data, then you can transform non normal data into normal data and still use the test. 

4. Why do we conduct tests of significance?
In order to see if we should retain or reject the null hypothesis for an alternative one.

5. What does the null hypothesis state?
Everything is equal, there are no differences between the groups in the study

6. What is meant when the null hypothesis is retained? Rejected?
Retained - It means that the sample did not contain any significant differences 
Rejected - The sample contained significant differences and the alternative hypothesis was accepted. 
7. Is it appropriate to declare a null hypothesis such as H0: ùúá= b to be true if the results are
‚ÄúNonsignificant‚Äù?
No, because there is always a chance that the sample did not include the differences.
 So, the null hypothesis can never be proven.
8.
When testing a null hypothesis such as H0:
ùúá
= b, what can be said about a ‚Äúsignificant‚Äù

result?


9.
Explain what an Alpha level is.
The probability that you‚Äôre rejecting the null hypothesis when it‚Äôs true. Typically it is set at .05, or a 5% chance that you are making a mistake.

10.
What is a
P-value and how does it relate to an alpha level?
A p-value is the probability that the results you got from your sample would happen if the null hypothesis was true. So, if the p is less than the alpha, then the null hypothesis is considered to be false, and if p is greater the null is retained.

11.
What does a p-value tell us, and what does it not tell us?


12.
What is a Type 1 error? What is a Type 2 error?
Type one is when there is a false positive result, or rejecting the null hypothesis for the alternative when the null is true. Type 2 is when there is a false negative, or the alternative is true but we fail to reject the null.

13. Three hundred participants were randomly selected from a large public university 
research participant pool of about 6,500 undergraduate students. The 300 students were 
randomly assigned to one of three groups of equal size. All three groups watched a 10-
minute video and then answered a few questions. In Group 1, the video described the 
health benefits of regular exercise. In Group 2, the video presented an expert panel 
discussion of refugee issues. In Group 3, the video presented an expert panel discussion 
of refugee issues that included graphic images of injured children. After viewing the 
video, one of the questions asked, "Should the US increase the number of refugees it 
admits into our country each year?" The sample data are given below.
